title: Hello World
---
Welcome to my new blog!

A bit about me...I'm a software developer, and I'm interested in platforms and game development. I've worked on platforms at Microsoft and HBO, and soon I'll be joining Facebook to help bring VR to the web.

I'm not sure how this blog will evolve, but the plan is to post about web development, WebGL, WebVR, Chromium, electronics, racing drones, and whatever other topics interest me.

That's it for now, just wanted to say hi.  Stay tuned!
